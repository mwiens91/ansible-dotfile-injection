# ssh-dotfile-injection

## Work in progress!!

Here you can find two scripts. One, `inject_pub_key.sh`, injects your
public key into a remote's authorized keys file. The other,
`inject_dotfiles.sh` injects a certain structure of configuration
files—namely, mine—to a remote, making intelligent substitutions for
compatibility reasons.

# Usage

I'm going to write the scripts first, then I'll fill this in.
